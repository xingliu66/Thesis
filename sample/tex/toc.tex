\hline
 Device states & Dozing dominates the usage (50.6\%); wake-up accounts for 2\% of usage period; \\& wake-up sessions are short but frequent (72 per day on average) with various root \\& causes  such as ``flick and look'' and push notifications. \\
\hline
 Push notifications  & Push notifications are used by 200+ apps, dominated by IM/emails, and exhibiting \\& bursty arrival patterns.  \\
\hline
 Smartwatch apps     & A wide spectrum of watch apps are observed; their execution is dominated by short \\& background services. \\
\hline
 Power models        & Accurate and comprehensive power models for two popular watches. The models \\& have error rates $<$6\%. \\
\hline
 Energy utilization  & Dozing and wake-up account for 56\% and 27\% of overall energy respectively. At \\& component level, CPU (29\%) and display (30\%) dominate the energy consumption. \\& Network consumes only 3.4\% of the energy. \\
\hline
 Energy optimization & ``What-if'' analysis over real data for improving energy efficiency; impact of state \\& machine on battery drain. \\
\hline
 Network traffic     & Watches are paired with phones during 84\% of the daytime; most flows are small, \\& short, slow, and bursty. \\
